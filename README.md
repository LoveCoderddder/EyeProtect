Congenital color vision disorder is often called color blindness, it can not distinguish all kinds of colors in the natural spectrum or a certain color; and color discrimination is called weak, weak color, although can see the color seen by normal people, but the ability to recognize color is slow or very poor, in darker light, some almost and color blindness. Not much, or color fatigue, which is generally not easily distinguishable from color blindness. Color blindness and color weakness are mostly congenital factors. Male patients are far more than female patients.

It is generally believed that red-green blindness is determined by two pairs of genes on the X chromosome, namely the red-blind gene and the green-blind gene. Since these two genes are closely linked on the X chromosome, a gene symbol is often used. The genetic mode of red green blindness is X linked recessive inheritance. A male has only one X chromosome, so only one color blindness gene can show color blindness. There are two X chromosomes in the female, so a pair of pathogenic alleles will be abnormal. If a normal woman marries a color-blind man, the father's color-blindness gene can be passed on to their daughter on the X chromosome, not to her son. The daughter passed on her father's color blindness gene to her son, which is called cross inheritance.

Color blindness is divided into total color blindness and partial color blindness (red blindness, green blindness, bluish yellow blindness, etc.). Color weakness includes whole color weakness and partial color weakness (red weak, green weak, blue yellow weak, etc.).

1. total color blindness

It belongs to complete cone cell dysfunction, contrary to nocturnal blindness (rod cell dysfunction), especially in patients with dark, photophobia, showing diurnal blindness. There is only light and shade without color difference, and the red hair is dark and blue. In addition, there are also symptoms such as poor vision, amblyopia, central scotoma and pendulous nystagmus. It is the most serious disorder of color vision.

2. red blindness

Also known as the first color blindness. The patients were mainly unable to distinguish red from dark green, blue from purple and purple. Green is often regarded as yellow, purple as blue, and green and blue as white.

3. green blindness

Also known as second color blindness, patients can not distinguish light green and dark red, purple and cyan blue, purple and gray, green as gray or dark black. Clinically, red blindness and green blindness are collectively referred to as red green color blindness, which is more common. Generally speaking, color blindness usually refers to red and green color blindness.

4. blue and yellow blindness

Also known as third color blindness. Patients are confused in blue and yellow, but are rare in red and green.

5. all color weak

Also known as red, green, blue, yellow and weak. The degree of color vision disorder was lower than that of panchromatic blindness. There was no abnormal vision and no other complications of panchromatic blindness. When objects are deep and bright, they can be distinguished; if color is shallow and unsaturated, it is difficult to distinguish.

The 6. part is color weak.

There are red weak (first color weak), green weak (second color weak) and blue-yellow weak (third color weak) and so on, of which red-green weak is more common, patients with poor sensitivity to red and green, poor lighting, its color discrimination ability is close to red-green blindness; but the material color is deep, bright and good illumination, its color discrimination ability is close to normal.
